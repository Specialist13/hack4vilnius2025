## Mock Data
Currently using mock data in the following files for demonstration:
- `/app/forum/page.tsx` - Sample posts with different statuses
- `/app/forum/post/[id]/page.tsx` - Sample post with replies

## Next Steps for Backend Integration

1. **Replace mock data with actual API calls**:
   - Update `fetchPosts()` in `/app/forum/page.tsx`
   - Update `fetchPost()` in `/app/forum/post/[id]/page.tsx`
   - Update form submissions in `/app/forum/create/page.tsx`

2. **Implement backend endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/forum/posts` - List posts with pagination and filters
   - `GET /api/forum/posts/:id` - Get single post with replies
   - `POST /api/forum/posts` - Create new post
   - `POST /api/forum/posts/:id/replies` - Add reply
   - `POST /api/forum/posts/:id/support` - Toggle support
   - `POST /api/forum/posts/:id/view` - Increment views

3. **Authentication integration**:
   - Protect post creation (require login)
   - Associate posts with user accounts
   - Display actual user avatars and names

4. **Additional enhancements**:
   - Image upload for posts
   - Edit/delete functionality for own posts
   - Notification system for replies
   - Email notifications for updates
   - Advanced filtering (by date, popularity)
   - Pagination for large post lists

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **UI Components**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS
- **Internationalization**: next-intl for EN/LT translations
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Date Formatting**: date-fns
- **Forms**: React Hook Form (ready for integration)
- **Notifications**: Custom toast hook
