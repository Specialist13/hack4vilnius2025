We help neighbors find each other, share experiences, and coordinate efforts to bring charging stations to their buildings."

          {
            "q": "What types of EV charging stations are suitable for apartment buildings?",
            "a": "Most apartment buildings install Level 2 (AC) charging stations, which typically provide 7-22 kW of power. These can fully charge most EVs overnight. The specific type depends on your building's electrical capacity, parking setup, and budget. Common solutions include wall-mounted chargers in individual parking spots or shared charging stations in common areas."
          },
          {
            "q": "How much does it cost to install EV charging in an apartment building?",
            "a": "Costs vary significantly based on several factors: the number of charging points, electrical infrastructure upgrades needed, parking layout, and chosen equipment. A single charging point can cost €1,500-€5,000, while comprehensive building-wide solutions may cost €20,000-€100,000+. Many buildings start with a pilot project of 2-5 charging points. EU and Lithuanian government grants may be available to offset costs."
          },
          {
            "q": "Does our building need electrical upgrades?",
            "a": "It depends on your building's current electrical capacity and how many charging stations you plan to install. A professional electrical assessment is recommended. Many modern buildings can accommodate several charging points with minimal upgrades, while older buildings may need significant electrical work. Load management systems can help optimize existing capacity."

          {
            "q": "Do I need permission from my building management?",
            "a": "Yes, in most cases you will need approval from your building's homeowners association (HOA) or management company. The approval process varies, but typically requires presenting a proposal at a homeowners meeting. Having multiple interested residents (which Chargington helps you find) strengthens your case significantly."
          },
          {
            "q": "What are the legal requirements in Lithuania?",
            "a": "Lithuanian law (Law on Construction, Building Technical Regulation STR 1.01.03:2017) requires new residential buildings to have infrastructure for EV charging. For existing buildings, Lithuanian Civil Code allows homeowners to request modifications for EV charging, but requires majority approval from the HOA. The Building Management Law outlines the decision-making process."
          },
          {
            "q": "Can I install a charging station just for my parking spot?",
            "a": "In most cases, yes, but you still need HOA approval even for a private installation. You'll typically need to: 1) Get electrical capacity assessment, 2) Present plans to HOA, 3) Get majority vote approval, 4) Hire certified electrician, 5) Cover all costs yourself. However, coordinating with neighbors (via Chargington) can lead to better, more cost-effective solutions for everyone."

            "a": "While one person can propose the idea, having 3-5 interested residents significantly increases your chances of success. This shows real demand and makes the cost-per-resident more attractive. Chargington helps you find these neighbors in your building."
          },
          {
            "q": "What are the typical steps to get EV charging installed?",
            "a": "1) Find interested neighbors (use Chargington!), 2) Get electrical capacity assessment, 3) Obtain quotes from installation companies, 4) Prepare proposal with costs and timeline, 5) Present to HOA meeting, 6) Get majority vote approval, 7) Sign contracts and begin installation, 8) Typically takes 3-12 months total."
          },
          {
            "q": "How do I convince skeptical neighbors?",
            "a": "Focus on: 1) Future-proofing the building (EV adoption is growing rapidly), 2) Increasing property values, 3) No cost to non-EV owners if users pay for installation and electricity, 4) Environmental benefits, 5) Share success stories from other buildings (found in Chargington forum)."
