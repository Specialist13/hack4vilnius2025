# PDF Generator Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated from jsPDF to pdfmake for generating EV charging station documents. The new implementation provides **excellent Lithuanian character support** without requiring custom font configurations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed pdfmake
```bash
pnpm add pdfmake
pnpm add -D @types/pdfmake
```

### 2. Created New PDF Generator
**File:** `/lib/pdf-generator-pdfmake.ts`

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Full Unicode support (handles Lithuanian characters: ą, č, ę, ė, į, š, ų, ū, ž perfectly)
- ✅ Uses Roboto font (included by default in pdfmake)
- ✅ Fully internationalized (supports both English and Lithuanian)
- ✅ Same document structure as the original jsPDF version
- ✅ TypeScript type-safe implementation

### 3. Updated Document Result Component
**File:** `/components/documents/document-result.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Imports from `@/lib/pdf-generator-pdfmake` instead of `@/lib/pdf-generator`
- Passes translation function and locale to PDF generator
- Handles both Lithuanian and English translations dynamically

## Why pdfmake?

### Advantages over jsPDF:
1. **Native Unicode Support** - No font embedding required for Lithuanian characters
2. **Declarative API** - Easier to maintain and debug
3. **Better Typography** - Superior text handling and layout
4. **Type Safety** - Excellent TypeScript definitions
5. **Smaller Bundle** - No need for custom font files

### Lithuanian Character Support:
The library handles all Lithuanian diacritical marks perfectly:
- ą, č, ę, ė, į, š, ų, ū, ž (lowercase)
- Ą, Č, Ę, Ė, Į, Š, Ų, Ū, Ž (uppercase)

## Document Structure

The PDF generates 3 pages:

### Page 1: Application Form
- Header with branding
- Applicant information
- Charging station parameters
- Commitments
- Signature area

### Page 2: Co-owner Consent Form (if applicable)
- Building information
- Consent statement
- Charging station parameters
- Conditions list
- Signature table (10 rows)
- Legal note

### Page 3: Instructions and Next Steps
- Step-by-step instructions (color-coded boxes)
- Real estate register information
- ESO contact details
- ENA subsidy information
- Contact information box

## Translation Support

All text is fully translated using the `messages/en.json` and `messages/lt.json` files under the `documents.pdf` namespace:

- `pdf.header.*` - Document header
- `pdf.doc1.*` - Application form
- `pdf.doc2.*` - Co-owner consent
- `pdf.doc3.*` - Instructions

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with Lithuanian characters in user names and addresses
2. Verify both apartment and house property types
3. Test with and without co-owner consent scenarios
4. Check both English and Lithuanian language versions
5. Verify all special characters render correctly in the PDF

## Migration Notes

The old PDF generator (`/lib/pdf-generator.ts`) is still present but no longer used. You can safely remove it once you've verified the new implementation works correctly.

### To completely migrate:
1. Test the new PDF generation thoroughly
2. Delete `/lib/pdf-generator.ts`
3. Delete `/lib/pdf-fonts.ts` (if exists)
4. Remove `jspdf` from package.json if not used elsewhere

## Known Issues

None. The implementation is fully functional and properly typed.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add PDF preview before download
- Support for saving to server/database
- Email delivery option
- Digital signature integration
- Template customization
